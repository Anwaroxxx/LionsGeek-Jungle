## 📍 Overview
During my time in the **LionsGeek Jungle**, I focused entirely on mastering **Bash scripting** — learning how to automate tasks, manage files, and write efficient shell scripts that interact directly with the Linux system.

This experience strengthened my understanding of the command line and helped me build a solid foundation in scripting and automation.

---

## 🐚 What I Learned
- Understanding **Linux commands** and how the shell works  
- Writing **custom Bash scripts** for automation  
- Using **variables, loops, and conditionals** in Bash  
- Managing **permissions, files, and processes**  
- Creating simple **tools and utilities** through scripts  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Environment
- **OS:** Arch / Linux terminal  
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Shell:** Bash  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

## 💭 Reflections
The Jungle taught me that even the smallest scripts can automate big parts of a developer’s workflow.  
Learning Bash gave me a deeper understanding of what happens “under the hood” of every Linux command — and that’s a powerful skill for any developer.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Dive deeper into **Shell scripting** with advanced topics like redirections, subshells, and process control  
- Combine Bash with **Python* / and webdev* for hybrid automation  
- Apply scripting knowledge in **DevOps and system automation** projects
